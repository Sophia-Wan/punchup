Punch Up Ideation
------------------
Ideation: Where the landing page of my name has small interactions, like when users hover a letter is shakes, and if they click on some letters to much the letter may drop or something hiding behind it will appear.

It'll help enhance my work, as the first thing people will see when they click into my portfolio is an interactive title that can be played around with. It will be kind of like a game loading screen where it introduces me instead.

Fears and Uncertainty: Some things I'm worried about are when I start actively coding this out, it doesn't look as well as I imagined due to a possible lack of skills/knowledge on how to create it through code.
